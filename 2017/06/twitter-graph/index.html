<p>When it comes to discovering or consuming real-time content, Twitter is the place to be; be it sending out ‘Tweets’ real-time, or discovering latest online ‘Trends’ anywhere, or ability to begin a ‘conversation’ with anyone, Twitter does it all. In fact, Twitter Management wrote this in their <a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2F526X/106725176x0x874459/8A4D1A1D-D184-4AFE-9AC1-F880C5EA06F1/Q415_Shareholder_Letter.pdf">letter to shareholders</a> last year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We’re focused now on what Twitter does best: live. Twitter is live: live commentary, live connections, live conversations. Whether it’s breaking news, entertainment, sports, or everyday topics, hearing about and watching a live event unfold is the fastest way to understand the power of Twitter.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Twitter has always been considered a “second screen” for what’s happening in the world and we believe we can become the first screen for everything that’s happening now. And by doing so, we believe we can build the planet’s largest daily connected audience. A connected audience is one that watches together, and can talk with one another in real-time. It’s what Twitter has provided for close to 10 years, and it’s what we will continue to drive in the future</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Embedded in a Twitter User’s Social-graph is a wealth of information on user’s likes and interests, and also implicit social-circles. Unlike Facebook or LinkedIn, the uniqueness of Twitter is in its ‘Follow’ structure - where any can follow any without they knowing each other. This directed social-graph, when methodologically summarized, can reveal interesting information on the most influential/central friends in one’s network and also help enrich one’s Twitter experience by surfacing implicit social-circles in the network.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll look into below topics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Extract the ego-network of ‘self’ using Twitter API</li>
<li>Identify the influential nodes using ‘Page Rank’ formulation</li>
<li>Identify implicit clusters formed</li>
<li>Recommend new friends to follow on the basis of influential-nodes in cluster of interest</li>
</ol>
<p>Note 1: This analysis is limited to <strong>ego network</strong> i.e. the focal node (<strong>ego</strong>: here <em>the self-node</em>) and the nodes to whom ego is directly connected to (<strong>alters</strong>) plus the <strong>ties</strong>, if any, among the alters.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Complete <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong> with <strong>Python</strong> source-code and intermediate-outputs are posted <a href="https://github.com/balaca/twitter_graph/blob/master/Twitter_PageRankAnalysis.ipynb">here</a>. This blog includes only snippets of <strong>Python</strong> code. Plots and tables are redrawn/re-rendered in <strong>R</strong> while composing this <em>R Markdown</em> document.</p>
<div id="extract-social-graph-strucutre-using-twitter-api" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Extract social-graph strucutre using Twitter API</h2>
<p>Twitter API is used to extract the data of ego-network i.e. the nodes followed by self (that’s me), and first-degree ‘Follows’ of those nodes. This Graph of (Vertices, Edges) is used to build an <code>adjacency matrix</code>.</p>

</div>
<div id="identify-influential-friends-using-page-rank-formulation" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Identify influential friends using ‘Page Rank’ formulation</h2>
<p>From the adjacency matrix, we can create a column-stochastic matrix (aka Markov transition matrix in random-surfer model) such that, a column with <code>m</code> outlinks will have <code>1/m</code> as value in respective <code>m</code> cells.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>binaryMap_cfr      = binaryMap_rfc.transpose()            # column-values: Outlinks
binaryMap_cfr_norm = binaryMap_cfr / binaryMap_cfr.sum(axis = 0)
colStochMatrix = np.matrix( binaryMap_cfr_norm.fillna(0)) # column-stochastic-matrix</code></pre>
<p><em>Initialize PageRank vector such that all nodes have equal PageRank score, adding upto 1.</em></p>
<pre class="python"><code>pageRankVector = np.matrix([1.0/len(index)] *  len(index)) # iniitialize page-rank-vector 
pageRankVector = pageRankVector.transpose()                # transpose to column-vector</code></pre>
<p>On applying Transition-matrix transformation iteratively on PageRank vector, vector will eventully converge such that: <code>Matrix.Vector = Vector</code>. Equivalently, this is eigen-vector formulation with PageRank vector being the principal eigen-vector corresponding to eigen-value <code>1</code> [Since it’s a column-stochastic matrix, principal eigen-value is 1].</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : To understand how <code>PageRank</code> works, this <a href="http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/">interactive tutorial</a> from <strong>Setosa</strong> is a good place to start.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>while epsilon &gt; (1.0/(10**16)):
    pageRankVectorUpdating = colStochMatrix * pageRankVector * beta 
    
    # re-insert leaked page-ranks
    S                      = np.array(pageRankVectorUpdating).sum()                      
    pageRankVectorUpdated  = pageRankVectorUpdating + 
               (1 - S) * (1.0/len(index)) * np.ones_like(len(index))
    
    # compute the squared-difference and check for convergence
    error                  = np.array(pageRankVectorUpdated - pageRankVector)
    epsilon                = np.sqrt((error *  error).sum())   
    pageRankVector         = pageRankVectorUpdated    
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Sum of Page-Rank Scores: 1.0
Converged in 58 iterations</code></pre>
<div id="a.-histogram-of-pagerank-scores" class="section level4">
<h4>2a. Histogram of PageRank scores</h4>
<p>Let’s visualize distribution of scaled PageRank scores (scaled such that nodes have an average-score of 1). The plot gives an idea of how influential are the nodes, with respect to an average node (of say PageRank score = 1).</p>

<h2>3. Identify implicit clusters</h2>
<p>Ideally, the number of clusters are decided using a plot of within-cluster sum-of-squares-of-distances vs number of clusters. Here for simplicity, we use a simple heuristic to fix the number of clusters in advance (~ 10 clusters)</p>
<p><em>Here we are more interested in clustering behavior which surfaces from</em> <strong>who-follows-me</strong> <em>(network-driven) graph, rather than</em> <strong>who-do-I-follow</strong> <em>(self-driven). So the plan is to represent nodes as Observations and whether other nodes follow them or not (1 or 0) as Features (One Observation per row, and one Feature per column) Thus the input matrix must be such that any value in cell implies whether node in the column follows node in the row.</em></p>
<div id="a.-k-means-clustering" class="section level3">
<h3>3a. K-Means clustering</h3>
<p>K Means is a point-assignment based clustering-algorithm: here we start with k points chosen randomly as centroids and then assign the remaining points to k centroids by using certain distance measure (Euclidean / Cosine / Jaccardi). Then we compute new centroids, re-assign remaining points and repeat, until centroids converge.</p>

<p>One problem in K-Means algorithm is <strong>Curse of Dimensionality</strong> i.e. at higher-dimensions (here ~400 dimensions), any metric like ‘Euclidean distance’ or ‘Centre’ would have little meaning in the context of non-convex region.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>Spectral Clustering</strong> attempts to partition the graph such that number of edges which connect different components are minimized. It uses <strong>eign-vector</strong> based approach to partition the graph. Below is the output from Spectral Clustering.</p>

<h2>5. Social Graph (Nodes, Links) in 3d space (using igraph)</h2>
<p>In the PCA section, we saw the nodes visualized in 2D space. <strong>igraph</strong> module offers richer network-analysis capabilities in R. Let’s visualize nodes in 3D by using <strong>igraph</strong> and <strong>threejs</strong> packages in R.</p>
<p>For simplicity, let’s look only at important nodes: say, nodes with <em>&gt;50 inlinks</em> in initial ego-network. Colors correspond to <strong>Spectral Clustering</strong> output and node-size is proportional to <strong>PageRank</strong>. Three dimensions from <strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong> output are used to fix nodes in 3D space.</p>
<p>( <em>Press and hold the left mouse button and move the mouse to</em> <strong>rotate</strong> <em>the plot. Press and hold the right mouse button to</em> <strong>pan</strong>. <em>Use the mouse scroll wheel to</em> <strong>zoom</strong>. <em>Hover mouse-pointer over node-centre to display</em> <strong>FullName</strong>)</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather">Introduction:My previous post looked into most linked domains, in popular subreddits across the world. In that exploratary data analysis, I took a cluster of subreddits and did a comparative analysis of how (news-) domains linked, vary in their proportions within a cluster of subreddits. To a novice redditor though, it isn’t always clear which subreddits are alike, say, in terms of what they are about (for example, US Politics Wiki-rules), or, in terms of spatial proximity of subreddits, as extrapolated from redditors’ activity.</div>

One exception was December 1984 election when MG Ramachandran of AIADMK, incumbent Chief Minister then, won an absolute majority with 54% vote-share and retained his Chief Minister seat.
Fast forward 30 years, last May, we witnessed another such rarity when incumbent Chief Minister J Jayalalitha held onto her seat despite the anti-incumbency wave (partly from mishandling of floods), new parties mushrooming in the State and no popular party in AIADMK coaliation.</div>

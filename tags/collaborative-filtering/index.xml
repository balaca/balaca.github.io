      <description>Introduction:My previous post looked into most linked domains, in popular subreddits across the world. In that exploratary data analysis, I took a cluster of subreddits and did a comparative analysis of how (news-) domains linked, vary in their proportions within a cluster of subreddits. To a novice redditor though, it isn’t always clear which subreddits are alike, say, in terms of what they are about (for example, US Politics Wiki-rules), or, in terms of spatial proximity of subreddits, as extrapolated from redditors’ activity.</description>
